# Performance Optimizations Applied

This document outlines the performance optimizations applied to address the specific issues mentioned in the PageSpeed Insights audit.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Render Blocking Requests (Est. savings of 450ms)
- **Problem**: CSS files blocking initial render, delaying LCP
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Enhanced `CriticalCSS.tsx` with inline critical styles for above-the-fold content
  - Added `DeferredCSSLoader.tsx` to load non-critical CSS asynchronously
  - Optimized webpack configuration to split CSS into critical and non-critical chunks
  - Added CSS optimization flags in `next.config.ts`

### 2. Reduce Unused JavaScript (Est. savings of 52KB)
- **Problem**: Large JavaScript bundles loading unnecessarily
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Implemented lazy loading for non-critical components in `layout.tsx`
  - Enhanced webpack bundle splitting configuration
  - Separated heavy libraries (LiveKit, DOMPurify, Floating UI) into async chunks
  - Added `DeferredScriptLoader.tsx` for analytics and non-critical scripts
  - Optimized chunk sizes and loading priorities

### 3. Defer Offscreen Images (Est. savings of 28KB)
- **Problem**: Hero images (hero1.webp, hero2.webp) loading eagerly when offscreen
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Optimized `ShopByCategory.tsx` to use lazy loading for images beyond the first 2
  - Enhanced `HeroSection.tsx` with better image loading priorities
  - Created `OptimizedLazyImage.tsx` component with intersection observer
  - Updated `ResourceHints.tsx` to be more selective about preloading
  - Added blur placeholders and optimized image quality settings

## Key Performance Improvements

### CSS Optimization
- **Critical CSS inlined** for faster above-the-fold rendering
- **Non-critical CSS deferred** until after initial paint
- **CSS chunks optimized** with proper caching strategies

### JavaScript Optimization
- **Lazy loading** for analytics, chat widgets, and performance monitors
- **Code splitting** by feature and library usage
- **Async loading** for heavy dependencies
- **Bundle size reduction** through selective imports

### Image Optimization
- **Lazy loading** with intersection observer for offscreen images
- **Progressive loading** with blur placeholders
- **Quality optimization** based on priority and device type
- **Selective preloading** only for critical images

### Resource Loading Strategy
- **Critical resources prioritized** with `fetchPriority="high"`
- **Non-critical resources deferred** until after initial load
- **Prefetching optimized** for likely navigation paths

## Files Modified

### Core Layout & Performance
- `/src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` - Added lazy loading and suspense
- `/src/components/performance/CriticalCSS.tsx` - Enhanced with critical styles
- `/src/components/performance/ResourceHints.tsx` - Selective resource loading
- `/src/components/performance/DeferredCSSLoader.tsx` - New: CSS loading optimization
- `/src/components/performance/DeferredScriptLoader.tsx` - New: Script loading optimization
- `/src/components/performance/OptimizedLazyImage.tsx` - New: Advanced image lazy loading

### Component Optimizations
- `/src/components/HeroSection.tsx` - Optimized image loading priorities
- `/src/components/ShopByCategory.tsx` - Implemented lazy loading for category images

### Configuration
- `/next.config.ts` - Enhanced webpack optimization and CSS splitting

## Expected Performance Gains

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **Faster CSS delivery** through critical CSS inlining
- **Reduced blocking resources** with deferred loading
- **Optimized image loading** for hero section

### FCP (First Contentful Paint)
- **Immediate critical styles** availability
- **Reduced JavaScript execution** blocking initial render
- **Streamlined resource loading** order

### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- **Blur placeholders** prevent layout shifts
- **Proper image sizing** with aspect ratios
- **Progressive enhancement** approach

### Bundle Size Reduction
- **52KB+ JavaScript savings** through code splitting
- **28KB+ image savings** through lazy loading
- **CSS optimization** reducing render blocking time

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Critical functionality loads first
2. **Lazy Loading**: Non-critical resources load on-demand
3. **Resource Prioritization**: High-priority resources marked appropriately
4. **Efficient Caching**: Optimized cache strategies for different resource types
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking maintained

## Monitoring & Testing

The optimizations preserve all existing functionality while improving performance metrics. The performance monitoring components continue to track:
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FCP, CLS)
- Resource loading times
- User interaction metrics

## Tailwind 4 Compatibility

All optimizations maintain compatibility with Tailwind 4:
- Critical CSS includes only essential styles
- Tailwind utilities remain unchanged
- Build process optimizations preserve Tailwind functionality
- No conflicts with Tailwind's CSS architecture

These optimizations should significantly improve the PageSpeed Insights scores while maintaining the existing design and functionality.
