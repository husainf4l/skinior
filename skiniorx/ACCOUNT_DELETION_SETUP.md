# Account Deletion Setup - Apple App Store Compliance

This document provides setup instructions for the account deletion feature that is required for Apple App Store compliance.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Update API Configuration

Edit `lib/app/config/api_config.dart` and update the `baseUrl`:

```dart
class ApiConfig {
  // Update this with your actual backend URL
  static const String baseUrl = 'https://your-backend-domain.com/api';

  // For development
  // static const String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:4008/api';
}
```

### 2. Backend Requirements

Your backend should implement the `DELETE /api/users/account` endpoint as described in your API documentation.

### 3. Test the Feature

1. Open the app and go to **Profile**
2. Scroll down to **Account Management** section
3. Tap **Delete Account**
4. Follow the confirmation process

## üì± User Experience Flow

1. **Access**: User goes to Profile ‚Üí Account Management ‚Üí Delete Account
2. **Warning**: First dialog explains consequences and data deletion
3. **Reason**: User can optionally provide reason for leaving
4. **Confirmation**: User must type "DELETE" to confirm
5. **Processing**: Loading dialog during API call
6. **Success**: Account deleted, user logged out, redirected to login
7. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with retry options

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`lib/app/services/account_deletion_service.dart`**

   - Handles API communication
   - Manages local data cleanup
   - Error handling and timeouts

2. **`lib/app/config/api_config.dart`**

   - Centralized API configuration
   - Easy URL updates for different environments

3. **`lib/app/views/profile_view.dart`**
   - Updated with account deletion UI
   - Multi-step confirmation process
   - User feedback collection

### Key Features:

‚úÖ **Apple Compliance**: Meets all App Store requirements  
‚úÖ **User Safety**: Multiple confirmation steps prevent accidents  
‚úÖ **Data Cleanup**: Clears all local storage after deletion  
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery  
‚úÖ **User Feedback**: Optional reason collection for improvement  
‚úÖ **Loading States**: Clear feedback during processing

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Uses existing auth token
- **Confirmation Text**: User must type "DELETE" to confirm
- **Request Timeout**: 30-second timeout prevents hanging
- **Local Cleanup**: All local data cleared after successful deletion

## üß™ Testing

### Test Cases to Verify:

1. **Valid Deletion**:

   - User provides correct confirmation text
   - Account successfully deleted on backend
   - ‚úÖ **All tokens cleared** (access token, refresh token)
   - ‚úÖ **Local storage completely cleared**
   - ‚úÖ **User logged out from Firebase/Google**
   - ‚úÖ **User redirected to login screen**
   - ‚úÖ **Success message shown**

2. **Token Verification**:

   - Before deletion: User should be logged in with valid tokens
   - After deletion: All AuthController observables should be reset:
     - `isLoggedIn.value` = `false`
     - `accessToken.value` = `''` (empty)
     - `userEmail.value` = `''`
     - `userName.value` = `''`
     - `userId.value` = `''`
     - `currentUser.value` = `null`

3. **Invalid Confirmation**:

   - User provides wrong confirmation text
   - Error message shown
   - Account remains active
   - Tokens remain valid

4. **Network Errors**:

   - Test with no internet connection
   - Test with invalid API URL
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly
   - Tokens should NOT be cleared if deletion fails

5. **Authentication Errors**:
   - Test with expired token
   - Verify re-login option is provided

### Debug Testing:

You can verify token clearing by checking the console logs during account deletion:

```
Starting local data cleanup...
Auth tokens and user data cleared via specialized logout
All local storage cleared
‚úÖ Local data cleanup completed successfully
```

### Manual Verification Steps:

1. **Before Deletion**:

   - Open app and verify user is logged in
   - Check Profile page shows user data
   - Note: User should be able to access protected features

2. **After Deletion**:
   - User should be on login screen
   - Cannot access any protected features
   - No stored user data in profile
   - App behaves as if user never logged in

### Testing Script:

```bash
# Test with curl (replace with your actual endpoint)
curl -X DELETE https://your-api.com/api/users/account \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "confirmationText": "DELETE",
    "reason": "Testing account deletion",
    "deleteData": true
  }'
```

## üìã Apple App Store Requirements Checklist

- ‚úÖ Account deletion easily discoverable in app
- ‚úÖ Clear explanation of what data will be deleted
- ‚úÖ User confirmation required before deletion
- ‚úÖ Account deletion works without requiring contact with support
- ‚úÖ User data actually deleted from backend (your responsibility)
- ‚úÖ Process is straightforward and not unnecessarily complicated

## üîÑ Backend Integration

When your backend is ready, ensure it:

1. **Validates JWT token** for authentication
2. **Requires "DELETE" confirmation** text
3. **Actually deletes user data** as documented
4. **Cancels active subscriptions** if applicable
5. **Returns proper HTTP status codes**:
   - `200` for successful deletion
   - `400` for validation errors
   - `401` for authentication failures

## üö® Important Notes

- **Test thoroughly** before App Store submission
- **Update API URL** in `api_config.dart` before production
- **Verify backend endpoint** matches your API documentation
- **Test all error scenarios** to ensure good UX
- **Consider data export** feature if users need their data before deletion
