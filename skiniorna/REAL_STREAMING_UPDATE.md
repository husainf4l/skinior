# Real Streaming Implementation

## ✅ What's Fixed

I've implemented **real streaming** to replace the previous "fake streaming" that was just adding delays between characters.

### 🔄 Real Streaming (NEW)

- **XMLHttpRequest-based**: Uses actual streaming HTTP requests
- **Server-Sent Events**: Properly parses your SSE format
- **Live Updates**: Content appears as it's received from the server
- **Section Filtering**: Only shows `final_answer` content (filters out `thought` sections)

### 📱 How It Works Now

1. **Real-time parsing** of your SSE stream:

   ```
   event: content
   data: {"content": "Hello!", "section": "final_answer", "type": "final_answer"}
   ```

2. **Immediate display** of each content chunk as received
3. **Proper completion** handling when `[DONE]` is received

### 🔧 Debug Features

- **Status Indicator**: Shows "🔄 Real Streaming" vs "📡 Standard Mode"
- **Toggle Button**: Lightning bolt icon to switch modes
- **Console Logs**: Detailed streaming logs:
  - `🔄 STREAMING CHUNK`: Raw data chunks
  - `📦 PARSED DATA`: Parsed JSON objects
  - `✅ SENDING CHUNK`: Content being displayed
  - `🏁 STREAMING COMPLETE`: When done

### 🎯 What You'll See

**Before (Fake)**: Artificial character-by-character delays
**Now (Real)**: Content appears exactly as your server sends it

Send a message and watch the console - you'll see the real SSE events being parsed and displayed in real-time!

### 💡 Technical Details

- Uses `XMLHttpRequest.onprogress` for real streaming
- Parses SSE format properly
- Filters content by `section === 'final_answer'`
- Handles network errors and timeouts
- 30-second timeout for long responses
